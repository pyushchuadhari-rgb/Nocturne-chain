# Nocturne Chain

**"In the shadows, wealth moves unseen."**

Nocturne Chain is a minimalist, elegant privacy protocol for Ethereum that allows users to break on-chain linkability of funds using a simple commit-reveal scheme — inspired by classic mixers like Tornado Cash, but stripped to its philosophical core.

## Project Description

Nocturne enables anonymous transactions by allowing users to:
1. Deposit a fixed amount (1 ETH) along with a cryptographic commitment.
2. Later withdraw the same amount to any new address using a secret that proves ownership — without revealing the link between deposit and withdrawal on-chain.

This creates true financial privacy in an increasingly transparent world.

## Project Vision

To bring nocturnal privacy to the daylight of public blockchains — where every individual can transact with the grace and mystery of starlit movement.  
We envision a future where financial sovereignty and personal privacy are default human rights on the internet.

## Key Features

- Fixed 1 ETH deposit pools (anonymity set grows with each deposit)
- Simple commit-reveal scheme (no complex zero-knowledge proofs required)
- Double-spending protection via nullifier pattern
- Fully non-custodial — funds never leave the contract until withdrawn
- Minimalist, auditable, and upgradable design

## Future Scope

- Variable deposit amounts with merkle tree anonymity sets
- Integration with zk-SNARKs for full privacy (Semaphore / RLN)
- Cross-chain nocturnal bridges
- NFT-based "Nocturne Passes" for priority or enhanced privacy
- Gas-optimized version using transient storage (EIP-1153)
- Mobile-first stealth addresses (ERC-5564 / ERC-6538 ready)

**The night is young. Privacy never sleeps.**
